# ❇️ Excel Sheet Generator (ESG)
A random data generator using AI. The idea behind this project started when I was practicing on Power BI. I noticed that I spent a lot of time searching for some dummy data to work on, especially in Kaggle. So we created this project to generate dummy data on an Excel sheet, where we specify the data we generate, to practice Power BI or Excel. With the help of Abdulrahman, who has worked before with OpenAI's API, we've managed to complete this project.

It's a small university project with many areas to enhance, but the most important is what we've learned from this development journey.
